          <h1>What is Two Wheeler Insurance?</h1>
          <p>
            Two-wheeler insurance is a type of motor vehicle insurance designed
            specifically for motorcycles, scooters, and other two-wheelers. It
            provides financial protection against potential risks such as
            accidents, theft, natural disasters, and third-party liabilities. In
            India, having at least a basic Third-Party Liability insurance
            policy is legally mandatory under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
